# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Developed a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud by identifying patterns in historical transaction data. Trained and evaluated multiple algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree—on a dataset of past transactions to distinguish fraudulent from legitimate activity.
